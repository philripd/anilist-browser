Anime Browser is an unofficial client for [AniList](https://anilist.co/), a place where you can track, share, and discover your favorite anime and manga.

This app started as an individual project by [Phillip Dang](https://github.com/philripd/) for CS 4750 (Mobile Application Development) at [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/) during the Spring 2022 semester. The course was taught by Associate Professor [Yu Sun](https://github.com/sunyu912/).
